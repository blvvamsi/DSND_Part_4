# DSND_Part_4
Code required for data science nano degree part 4 project 

You will need to download the stack overflow dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017

The packages required to run this code are Numpy , Pandas , Math , Matplotlib

The questions i've tried to answer using this dataset are 
1. Is it better to work in developed countries like US and European Union or Developing asian countries
2. What do developers think about their pay scale?
3. Comparison of Job satisfaction between these two groups of countries

The notebook attached to this repository answers all the above questions

The final results of my analysis cab be found in this medium article
